Flush Gemmini TLB of stale virtual addresses
Initialize our input and output matrices in main memory
Calculate the scratchpad addresses of all our matrices
  Note: The scratchpad is "row-addressed", where each address contains one matrix row
Move "In" matrix from main memory into Gemmini's scratchpad
Move "Identity" matrix from main memory into Gemmini's scratchpad
Multiply "In" matrix with "Identity" matrix with a bias of 0
Move "Out" matrix from Gemmini's scratchpad into main memory
Fence till Gemmini completes all memory operations
Check whether "In" and "Out" matrices are identical
Input and output matrices are identical, as expected
[UART] UART0 is here (stdin/stdout).
